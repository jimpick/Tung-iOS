### Backstory

#### In the beginning...
Tung is a passion project I started in January of 2014. It began as a sound clip sharing app that let you record sounds and share them to your friends. After releasing a beta, I quickly realized that content quality was an issue, not to mention motivating people to create content at all. With this problem, and the advent of other clip-sharing apps emerging, I pivoted. I was already a huge fan of podcasts and podcasts are generally well-produced and are very clip worthy. Also, discovery was hard. So I set out to reinvent Tung as a way to discover podcasts, by allowing users to recommend, comment on and make clips from podcasts. All this would appear in a feed that would help you discover podcasts.

#### Release 
I released Tung to the App Store on 7/22/2016. Despite being a huge personal accomplishment for me to ship it myself, with no funding, it only received just under 100 upvotes on Product Hunt. I also had less than 50 beta testers. Why did this matter? Much of the value of Tung lies in the network effect, and you have to reach a critical mass of users for the network effect to be realized. Despite having a group of loyal users, Tung didn't organically grow to reach that critical mass.

#### Today
Tung is a full-featured podcast player with some special and unique abilities. Despite debuting a year before the [YC-backed competition](https://breaker.audio/) that also positions itself as a social podcast player, it hasn't reached the critical mass of users. But Tung remains my favorite podcast player (I'm not biased) and I still discover new podcasts on it. However since it's not funded or monetized, I can't devote enough time to nurture it and iterate on it.

#### Here's to the future
My hope is that as an open-source podcast player, Tung can be nurtured by the community or at the very least serve as a resource for other developers.
